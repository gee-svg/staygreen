    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Welcome to our Tree Planting initiative! We are a group of passionate friends and students to promoting sustainable practices through tree planting projects. Our mission is to inspire communities, especially students, to take part in environmental conservation and make a positive impact on the planet.</p>

    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>We envision a greener, healthier, and more sustainable future for our country. Through our tree planting campaigns, we aim to combat climate change, restore ecosystems, and improve local biodiversity. By engaging friends and students in hands-on environmental initiatives, we hope to cultivate a sense of responsibility towards nature and encourage future generations to act as stewards of the Earth.</p>

    <h3>Why Tree Planting?</h3>
    <p>Tree planting plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide, improving air quality, and providing shelter for wildlife. As friends and students, we believe that by actively participating in such projects, we can contribute to the restoration of our environment and build a better future. Trees also enhance local landscapes, create green spaces, and offer many social and economic benefits to the communities involved.</p>

    <h3>Our Country, Our Responsibility</h3>
    <p>Our country faces numerous environmental challenges, including deforestation, pollution, and the effects of climate change. By organizing tree planting campaigns, we aim to address these issues and work towards a more sustainable future. We believe that every small action can have a big impact, and by planting trees, we contribute to the health and prosperity of our nation.</p>

    <h3>Get Involved</h3>
    <p>If you're a student or anyone passionate about the environment, join us in our mission! Whether it's planting trees, raising awareness, or participating in local campaigns, there are many ways you can get involved and make a difference. Together, we can create a greener, more sustainable world for generations to come.</p>

        <h2>Recent Tree Planting group Overview</h2>

        <p>We planted mangrove trees as part of our environmental conservation initiative. The variety we selected was the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizophora_mangle" target="_blank">Red Mangrove</a>, known for its ability to thrive in coastal areas with saline conditions.

                <h3>Location of Planting</h3>
                <div class="tree-planting-photo photo-area">
                    <p>Planting area for mangrove trees in Bidesi park shoreline.</p>
                </div>
                <p>The trees were planted in the coastal wetlands of Bidesi park shoreline, a region that has seen significant ecological changes due to climate factors. The location is ideal for mangrove growth due to its proximity to seawater, which provides the necessary salinity for these trees. The rich, nutrient-filled soil and the tidal conditions further contribute to the thriving of mangroves in this area. This location offers protection from strong waves and provides an essential habitat for local wildlife.</p>

                <h3>Suitability for Growth and Care</h3>
                <div class="tree-planting-photo photo-place">
                    <p>Mud area where suitable for mangrove growth.</p>
                </div>
                <p>The site was chosen for its natural conditions favorable to mangrove growth, with minimal disturbances to the ecosystem. The area's low-lying, muddy shores allow mangrove trees to root well, and the fluctuating water levels help in the development of their specialized root systems. The area is also easily accessible for ongoing care and monitoring, ensuring the proper growth and sustainability of the planted trees.</p>
